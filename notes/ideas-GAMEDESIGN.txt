i wanted to make it Vakhitest 7 but... why?

A game about my personal life...
(this is changed up to be more game like ofc lol)

maybe i'll get some dream inspirating me one day... thats not total bullshit about time travelling or adventures and fake childhood

GAME IDEA:
some real life rpg like roleplay (using vakhitest 6's engine)
dodge the human (lmao)

i want to make a rpg but its MY real life

i am so determined right now
im going to do it
i want to make the game so badly.

GAME IDEA 2:
no these are not different ideas im just too lazy to name the categories

like ...
its my current home town
people are changed versions of ... people(copy right and privacy i guess) but should still make sense
maybe an rpg... like people trying to talk to me are some sort of (YES RPG) fight fitting to their character (did i already say rpg)
rpg
you gotta stay at home to regenerate hp...
you have minus hp cuz u dont care lol
but when its too low its like game over and resetting the day?
u have a weirdness meter and when its too high you loose hp until you hide or something...
happy meter...(cant do x because happy meter is lower than y)
if happy meter is too high or too low you cant do some stuff
alright thats it for today... day 12 September 22
i will just make it in Vakhitest 6
